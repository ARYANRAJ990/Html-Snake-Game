# HTML-Sanke-Game

HTML Game has been there for quite a while. It is one of the most popular and favorite technologies used by game developers across the world. And why shouldn’t it be? HTML5 has everything a game developer needs, from offline asset storage, 2D & 3D graphics to audio APIs and support for all browsers.
<p>Most of the audience here already sees the value in HTML5, but I want to re-iterate why you should be building an HTML5 game. If you are just targeting iOS for your game, write the game in Objective-C, the cons outweigh the benefits in that scenario… but if you want to build a game that works on a multitude of platforms, HTML5 is the way to go.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of this are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>It is cross platform</li>
<li>It has a unique distribution</li>
<li>Quicker development process</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>stats.js – A JavaScript performance monitor. Displays framerate, and performance over time.</li>
<li>Socket.IO – realtime client-server communication (if you’re going to have a backend for your game).</li>
<li>pixi.js – A canvas and WebGL rendering engine.</li>
<li>CocoonJS – Improves HTML5 game performance on iOS and Android with an accelerated canvas bound to OpenGL ES.</li>
</ul>
